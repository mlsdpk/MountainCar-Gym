# Discretization using Uniform-Space Grid

Sometimes, we are facing with environments which have continuous state and action spaces. We'll deal with those environments by discretizing them. This will enable us to apply reinforcement learning algorithms that are only designed to work with discrete spaces. In this project, we'll use [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments to test and develop our algorithms. These simulate a variety of classic as well as contemporary reinforcement learning tasks.  

We're going to use a MountainCar environment that has a continuous state space, but a discrete action space. If you want to find more information and code implementation, check the provided notebook in this repository.
